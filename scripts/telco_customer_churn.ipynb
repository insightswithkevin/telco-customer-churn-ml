    "# Project: Reducing Customer Churn at Telco\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data-Driven Approach to Reducing Customer Attrition\n",
    "\n",
    "### Motivation & Personal Interest\n",
    "\n",
    "As an aspiring Data Scientist, I‚Äôm passionate about tackling real-world business problems where data analysis can drive measurable impact. The Telco Customer Churn dataset presents a perfect opportunity to apply my skills in machine learning and interpretable statistics while addressing a critical industry challenge: Why do customers leave?\n",
    "\n",
    "What excites me about this project:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Complexity: The dataset includes demographic, contractual, and service-related factors‚Äîideal for isolating key drivers of churn\n",
    "\n",
    "- Business Relevance: Customer attrition costs telecom companies billions annually\n",
    "\n",
    "- Skill Development: This project combines EDA, predictive modeling, and actionable insights\n",
    "\n",
    "### Goals & Methodology\n",
    "\n",
    "Using Python, I analyze the data and create visuals to answer the following questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Question 1: Which customer segments churn most‚Äîand why?**\n",
    "    - Approach: Explorative data analysis to visualize relationships between **`InternetService`**, **`MonthlyCharges`** and **`Churn`**\n",
    "    - Statistics: Logistic regression (**`statsmodels`**) to quantify impact\n",
    "- **Question 2: Can I build a simple yet effective churn prediction model?**\n",
    "    - Approach: Train a Random Forest (**`scikit-learn`**) using interpretable features (e.g., **`Contract`**, **`tenure`**)\n",
    "    - Business Value: Such a model could help telecoms proactively retain at-risk customers\n",
    "- **Question 3: Do add-on services (e.g., Tech Support) actually reduce churn?**\n",
    "    - Approach: Compare churn rates between customers with/without services, stratified by contract type\n",
    "\n",
    " ### Findings\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Question 1: Which customer segments churn most‚Äîand why?**\n",

    "### Identifying High-Risk Churn Segments: Key Drivers and Patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "This analysis investigates which customer segments are most prone to churning and examines the underlying reasons behind their attrition. The study focuses on four key hypothesized drivers of customer churn, which will be explored through exploratory data analysis and logistic regression modeling. First, we hypothesize that customers with shorter duration of contract duration (`tenure`) are more likely to churn (`Churn`) due to weaker customer-company bonding effects. Second, we expect to find that higher monthly charges (`MonthlyCharges`) lead to increased churn as customers become more price-sensitive. Third, we anticipate that fiber optic internet service subscribers (`InternetService`) will demonstrate higher churn rates compared to DSL users, potentially due to unmet higher expectations regarding service quality. Finally, we predict that customers with month-to-month contracts will churn more frequently than those with longer-term contracts (`Contract`), as the absence of contractual commitments reduces switching costs. These hypotheses will guide our investigation into the primary factors influencing customer retention in the telecommunications sector."

    "  - Customers with Fiber Optic internet are significantly more likely to churn than those with DSL (+0.98)\n",
    "    - In contrast, customers with no internet service are less likely to churn (‚Äì0.88)\n",
    "    - ‚Üí This suggests that high-performance internet (likely more expensive) may come with higher expectations ‚Äî and greater risk of dissatisfaction.\n",
    "- Contract type:\n",
    "  - A 1-year contract significantly reduces churn risk (‚Äì0.83)\n",
    "  - A 2-year contract has an even stronger effect (‚Äì1.66)\n",
    "  - ‚Üí This confirms earlier insights and provides a quantitative foundation for loyalty-focused strategies.\n",
    "- Tenure (contract duration): Each additional month with the company reduces the likelihood of churn (‚Äì0.033 per month), underlining the value of long-term customer relationships.\n",
    "- Monthly charges: Although initially suspected to drive churn, monthly cost shows no significant effect in the full model (p = 0.122). This indicates that pricing effects may be explained by other variables like contract type or internet service.\n",
    "- Age: Surprisingly, older customers have a higher likelihood of churn (+0.39). This could be due to tech-related frustration, lack of perceived value, or pricing concerns ‚Äî and suggests a need for targeted support strategies."

    "### Building an Effective Churn Prediction Model?\n",
    "\n",
    "The next section examines whether we can develop both simple and accurate churn prediction models by leveraging machine learning techniques. While traditional logistic regression offers valuable interpretability, machine learning approaches provide distinct advantages for this predictive modeling task. Specifically, ML algorithms can identify and model complex non-linear patterns in the data, account for intricate interactions between multiple variables, and ultimately deliver superior predictive performance compared to conventional statistical methods. For this analysis, we implement a **Random Forest classifier** - an ensemble method that combines multiple decision trees to reduce overfitting while maintaining robust performance across diverse data types. The model's ability to generate feature importance scores adds valuable interpretability to its predictions. Our optimization strategy focuses on three key aspects: First, we conduct comprehensive **hyperparameter tuning** to identify the optimal model configuration. Second, we **prioritize recall** as our primary evaluation metric, aiming to correctly identify at least 70% of actual churn cases, since failing to detect potential churners (false negatives) carries greater business risk than false alarms. This recall-focused approach ensures we minimize missed opportunities for customer retention interventions."

    "###  Analyzing Add-On Service Impact on Churn\n",
    "\n",
    "This investigation examines whether value-added services like Tech Support, Online Security, Online Backup, and Device Protection effectively reduce customer churn in telecommunications. We hypothesize that customers who subscribe to these premium services demonstrate lower attrition rates due to three key mechanisms: (1) enhanced perceived value of their service package, making them less likely to switch providers; (2) increased switching costs as these add-ons create more complex service integrations; and (3) improved overall customer experience through better support and protection features. The analysis specifically focuses on measuring the churn impact of four critical services: Technical Support, which provides troubleshooting assistance; Online Security, offering protection against digital threats; Online Backup for data preservation; and Device Protection covering hardware maintenance. By comparing churn rates between subscribers and non-subscribers of each service, we aim to quantify their true retention value and identify which offerings provide the strongest protective effect against customer attrition."
